#  **Maneike**
ðŸ‘ˆ That's me. My name is **Martin CheÅ‚miniak**. I go by `maneike` in most online places.

## I'm a Developer.
I'm a third-year computer science student at UAM in PoznaÅ„, Poland. Currently working as a junior developer at a wonderful company named Tonik. Somewhen in the future I would like to become a software architect, but for the time being I am studying and reading literature related to high-performing software engineering and high-quality software development.
