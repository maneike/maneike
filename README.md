#  **Maneike**
ðŸ‘ˆ That's me. My name is **Martin CheÅ‚miniak** but I go by `maneike` in most online places.

## I'm a Developer.
I'm a computer science graduate at UAM in PoznaÅ„, Poland.

Currently working as a software engineer @ Tonik, a design studio focused on early stage startups, helping founders define, design and build products.
Our (re)designs (mostly along with dev implementation) can be seen on **(Twilio) Segment**, **Langchain**, **Speakeasy**, **Chilipiper**, **Hydra** and many more!
